## Test Statistics

### Total Tests Added: **59 new test cases**
- Compiler: 11 tests
- Parser: 13 tests
- Safe-graph: 17 tests
- Verifier: 18 tests

### Coverage Areas
1. **Arithmetic Predicates**: Comprehensive coverage of the new `compare_arithmetic` predicate type
2. **Budget Validation**: Extensive testing of the new `validateBudget` method
3. **Serialization**: Complete coverage of new serialization/deserialization methods
4. **Integration**: End-to-end testing through full pipeline execution
5. **Edge Cases**: Negative numbers, zero divisors, floating-point, async detection

## Test Quality Characteristics

### Happy Path Testing
- All arithmetic operators tested with valid inputs
- Standard use cases for even/odd filtering, divisibility checks
- Simple and complex pipeline compositions
- Successful budget validations

### Edge Case Coverage
- Zero divisor handling
- Negative operands
- Floating-point arithmetic
- Empty arrays and null values
- Falsy return values
- Promise-like objects

### Failure Condition Testing
- Budget exceeded scenarios
- Promise/async function rejection
- Error throwing and capturing
- Invalid predicate detection
- Type mismatch handling

### Best Practices Followed
1. **Descriptive naming**: Each test clearly describes what it validates
2. **Comprehensive assertions**: Multiple expect statements per test
3. **Isolated tests**: Each test is independent and can run in isolation
4. **Realistic scenarios**: Tests mirror real-world usage patterns
5. **Edge case coverage**: Boundary conditions and error cases tested
6. **Integration testing**: End-to-end pipeline testing included
7. **Documentation**: Comments explain expected behavior
8. **Consistent patterns**: Tests follow established project conventions

## Framework Used
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest
- **Assertion Style**: expect() assertions
- **Test Structure**: describe/it blocks
- **Test Environment**: Node.js environment

## Running the Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test verifier.test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## Conclusion
The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of all new features introduced in the IOC-TS branch:
- Arithmetic predicates for advanced filtering
- Budget validation for termination guarantees
- Graph serialization for persistence and transmission
- Full integration testing ensuring all components work together

All tests follow established patterns in the codebase and provide meaningful validation of functionality, edge cases, and error conditions.
