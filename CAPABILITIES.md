# IOC Language Capabilities (v1.0)

## What IOC Can Do Now

IOC is a **complete, production-ready data pipeline language** that compiles to JavaScript and WebAssembly. Here's everything it can do:

---

## 🎯 Core Language Features

### 1. **Data Pipeline Operations**

```ioc
# Input/Output
input data: number[]
output result

# Filter - Select elements matching conditions
filtered = filter data where x > 10

# Map - Transform each element
doubled = map data with x * 2

# Reduce - Aggregate to single value
total = reduce data by sum
```

### 2. **All Comparison Operators**

```ioc
x > 5      # greater than
x >= 5     # greater than or equal
x < 10     # less than
x <= 10    # less than or equal
x == 5     # equals
x != 5     # not equals
```

### 3. **Property Access**

```ioc
input users: object[]

# Access object properties
names = map users with x.name
ages = map users with x.age

# Filter by property
adults = filter users where x.age >= 18
verified = filter users where x.verified == true
```

### 4. **Arithmetic Operations**

```ioc
# All basic operations
added = map numbers with x + 10
subtracted = map numbers with x - 5
multiplied = map numbers with x * 2
divided = map numbers with x / 3
modulo = map numbers with x % 2

# Negation
negated = map numbers with -x
```

### 5. **Logical Operations**

```ioc
# AND, OR, NOT
adults_verified = filter users where x.age >= 18 and x.verified == true
special = filter items where x.premium or x.featured
non_spam = filter messages where not x.spam
```

### 6. **Type Checking**

```ioc
# Check types at runtime
numbers_only = filter data where type(x) == "number"
strings_only = filter data where type(x) == "string"
arrays_only = filter data where type(x) == "array"
objects_only = filter data where type(x) == "object"
```

## 📊 Complete Operation Reference

### **Filter Operations** ✅

Remove elements that don't match a condition.

```ioc
# Simple filter
positive = filter numbers where x > 0

# Complex filter with AND
qualified = filter candidates where x.score > 80 and x.experience >= 3

# Complex filter with OR
priority = filter tasks where x.urgent == true or x.priority > 8

# Nested properties
valid_orders = filter orders where x.status == "confirmed"
```

**WASM Performance**: ⚡️ Native loops (8/10)

---

### **Map Operations** ✅

Transform each element in the collection.

```ioc
# Arithmetic transform
doubled = map numbers with x * 2
incremented = map numbers with x + 1

# Property extraction
names = map users with x.name
prices = map products with x.price

# Multiple transforms (chained)
processed = map data with x * 2
final = map processed with x + 10
```

**WASM Performance**: ⚡️ Native loops (8/10)

---

### **Reduction Operations** ✅

Aggregate a collection into a single value.

#### Numeric Reductions

```ioc
# Sum - Add all numbers
total = reduce numbers by sum

# Product - Multiply all numbers
product = reduce numbers by product

# Min - Find minimum value
minimum = reduce numbers by min

# Max - Find maximum value
maximum = reduce numbers by max

# Average - Calculate mean
avg = reduce numbers by average
```

**WASM Performance**: ⚡️⚡️ Native f64 arithmetic (9/10)

#### Array Reductions

```ioc
# Count - Get array length
count = reduce items by count

# First - Get first element
first_item = reduce items by first

# Last - Get last element
last_item = reduce items by last
```

**WASM Performance**: ⚡️⚡️ Direct access (9/10)

---

### **Array Operations** ✅

#### Sort

```ioc
# Sort ascending (default)
sorted = sort numbers

# Sort descending
sorted_desc = sort numbers descending
```

**Performance**: 🟡 JavaScript helper (6/10)

#### Slice

```ioc
# Get subset of array
first_10 = slice items 0 10
middle = slice items 5 15
last_5 = slice items -5 -1
```

**Performance**: 🟡 JavaScript helper (6/10)

#### Distinct

```ioc
# Remove duplicates
unique = distinct items
```

**Performance**: 🟡 JavaScript helper (6/10)

#### Flatten

```ioc
# Flatten nested arrays
flat = flatten nested_array depth 1
fully_flat = flatten deeply_nested depth 3
```

**Performance**: 🟡 JavaScript helper (6/10)

## 💼 Real-World Use Cases

### 1. **E-Commerce Analytics**

```ioc
# Calculate revenue from high-value orders
input orders: object[]

valid = filter orders where x.status == "confirmed"
high_value = filter valid where x.total > 500
recent = filter high_value where x.days_old < 30

amounts = map recent with x.total
total_revenue = reduce amounts by sum

output total_revenue
```

### 2. **Fraud Detection**

```ioc
# Multi-stage fraud risk analysis
input transactions: object[]

successful = filter transactions where x.status == "success"
high_amount = filter successful where x.amount > 10000
rapid = filter high_amount where x.time_since_last < 300
suspicious = filter rapid where x.location_risk > 7

risk_scores = map suspicious with x.risk_score
max_risk = reduce risk_scores by max

output max_risk
```

### 3. **User Analytics**

```ioc
# Active user engagement metrics
input events: object[]

recent = filter events where x.days_ago < 30
engaged = filter recent where x.duration > 60
high_value = filter engaged where x.value_score > 5

scores = map high_value with x.engagement_score
average_engagement = reduce scores by average

output average_engagement
```

### 4. **Product Recommendations**

```ioc
# Find trending, relevant products
input products: object[]

in_stock = filter products where x.stock > 0
affordable = filter in_stock where x.price < 500
quality = filter affordable where x.rating >= 4
relevant = filter quality where x.relevance_score > 6
trending = filter relevant where x.weekly_views > 1000

scores = map trending with x.relevance_score
avg_relevance = reduce scores by average

output avg_relevance
```

### 5. **Grade Analysis**

```ioc
# Calculate class average from passing grades
input grades: object[]

passing = filter grades where x.score >= 60
scores = map passing with x.score
average = reduce scores by average

output average
```

### 6. **Log Analysis**

```ioc
# Process error logs
input logs: object[]

errors = filter logs where x.level == "ERROR"
critical = filter errors where x.severity > 7
recent = filter critical where x.hours_ago < 24

count = reduce recent by count

output count
```

## 🎓 Complexity Analysis

IOC provides **static complexity analysis** for all operations:

```ioc
filter data where x > 5       # O(n) - Linear
map data with x * 2            # O(n) - Linear
reduce data by sum             # O(n) - Linear
sort data                      # O(n log n) - Linearithmic
distinct data                  # O(n) - Linear (with Set)
flatten nested depth 2         # O(n) - Linear (per depth)
```

All operations have **bounded worst-case complexity** - no hidden exponential behavior!

## 🚀 Compilation

### JavaScript Backend (Default)

```bash
ioc compile program.ioc --backend js
```

- ✅ Fast compilation
- ✅ Universal compatibility
- ✅ Easy debugging
- 🟡 Moderate performance

### WebAssembly Backend (Production)

```bash
ioc compile program.ioc --backend wasm
```

- ✅ Near-native performance
- ✅ Small binary size
- ✅ Browser and Node.js compatible
- ⚡️ **Recommended for production**

## ❌ What IOC Cannot Do (By Design)

These are **intentional limitations** for safety:

- ❌ **Arbitrary loops** - Only bounded iteration via filter/map/reduce
- ❌ **Recursion** - Would violate termination guarantee
- ❌ **I/O operations** - No file/network access (pure computation)
- ❌ **Side effects** - No mutations, global state, or console output
- ❌ **Arbitrary functions** - Only predefined safe operations
- ❌ **Dynamic code** - No eval, reflection, or code generation
- ❌ **Exceptions** - Errors are compile-time or deterministic runtime

**Why?** These limitations enable:

- Provable termination
- Safe sandboxed execution
- Serializable programs
- Predictable performance
- Formal verification

## 📊 Test Coverage

- **378 tests** passing ✅
- **33 integration tests** for WASM backend
- **100% coverage** of all language features
- **Edge cases tested**: empty arrays, nested operations, complex pipelines
