# Test Additions Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive unit tests added for the changes in the `ioc-ts` branch.

## Overview

Added extensive test coverage for:
1. Arithmetic predicate support (`compare_arithmetic` type)
2. SafeGraph serialization methods (`toJSON`, `fromProgram`, `fromJSON`)
3. Async function detection in budget validation
4. Parser support for arithmetic predicates
5. AST to graph conversion for arithmetic predicates

## Test Files Modified/Created

### 1. `src/tests/compiler.test.ts`
**Added:** Arithmetic Predicates test suite

**Coverage:**
- Compilation of all arithmetic operations (mod, multiply, add, subtract, divide)
- All comparison operators (eq, ne, gt, gte, lt, lte) with arithmetic predicates
- Working predicate functions for even number checks, divisibility, and arithmetic comparisons
- Edge cases: negative values, zero values, division by negative numbers
- **Total new tests:** ~25 tests

**Key test scenarios:**
```typescript
- x % 2 == 0 (even number check)
- x * 3 > 10 (multiplication with comparison)
- x + 5 >= 10 (addition with comparison)
- x - 10 < 50 (subtraction with comparison)
- x / 2 <= 25 (division with comparison)
```

### 2. `src/tests/safe-graph.test.ts`
**Added:** SafeGraph Serialization test suite

**Coverage:**
- `toJSON()` method serialization
- `fromProgram()` static method for reconstruction
- `fromJSON()` static method for deserialization (from string or object)
- Round-trip serialization/deserialization
- Complex graph preservation
- Metadata preservation
- Edge cases (empty graphs, graphs with only inputs, graphs with constants)
- Integration with compile() method
- **Total new tests:** ~20 tests

**Key test scenarios:**
```typescript
- Serialize complex pipeline graphs
- Reconstruct graphs from IOCProgram
- Round-trip JSON serialization
- Preserve all node details and capabilities
- Execute reconstructed graphs identically to originals
```

### 3. `src/tests/types.test.ts`
**Added:** Arithmetic Predicate Complexity and Type Safety tests

**Coverage:**
- Complexity class for `compare_arithmetic` predicates
- Arithmetic predicates in AND/OR combinations
- Negated arithmetic predicates
- Type safety for all arithmetic operations
- Type safety for all comparison operators
- Various comparison value types (number, string, boolean)
- **Total new tests:** ~10 tests

### 4. `src/tests/parser.test.ts`
**Added:** Parser Arithmetic Predicates test suite

**Coverage:**
- Parsing modulo predicates (x % 2 == 0)
- Parsing multiplication predicates (x * 2 > 10)
- Parsing addition predicates (x + 5 >= 10)
- Parsing subtraction predicates (x - 5 > 0)
- Parsing division predicates (x / 2 < 25)
- All comparison operators with arithmetic operations
- Edge cases: negative values, decimals, large numbers
- Distinction from simple comparison predicates
- String and boolean comparison values
- **Total new tests:** ~30 tests

### 5. `src/tests/ast-to-graph.test.ts` (NEW FILE)
**Added:** Complete AST to Graph Converter test suite

**Coverage:**
- Conversion of all arithmetic predicate types to SafeGraph
- Compilation and execution of arithmetic predicates
- Complex pipelines with arithmetic predicates
- Edge cases: negative values, decimals, zero
- Operator mapping verification (arithmetic and comparison)
- Integration with existing predicates (simple comparison, property)
- End-to-end testing from source code to execution
- **Total new tests:** ~25 tests

**Example integration test:**
```typescript
const source = `
  input numbers: number[]
  evens = filter numbers where x % 2 == 0
  doubled = map evens with x * 2
  total = reduce doubled by sum
  output total
`;
// Tests full pipeline: parse → convert → compile → execute
```

### 6. `src/tests/verifier.test.ts`
**Added:** Async Function Detection and Budget Validation edge cases

**Coverage:**
- Async function detection (async/await)
- Promise detection (Promise.resolve, Promise.reject, new Promise)
- Async arrow functions
- Async generators
- Thenable objects (non-Promise objects with `then` method)
- Nested promises in objects/arrays
- Multiple argument handling
- Rest parameters
- Error handling (custom errors, string throws, null/undefined throws)
- Timeout budget violations
- **Total new tests:** ~20 tests

## Test Execution

All tests use **Vitest** framework following the existing project conventions.

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test src/tests/compiler.test.ts

# Run in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Test Statistics

| File | New Tests | Categories |
|------|-----------|------------|
| compiler.test.ts | ~25 | Arithmetic predicates compilation |
| safe-graph.test.ts | ~20 | Serialization methods |
| types.test.ts | ~10 | Type safety and complexity |
| parser.test.ts | ~30 | Arithmetic predicate parsing |
| ast-to-graph.test.ts | ~25 | AST conversion |
| verifier.test.ts | ~20 | Async detection & edge cases |
| **TOTAL** | **~130** | **6 test suites** |

## Coverage Goals

All tests aim to achieve:
- ✅ **Happy path coverage**: Normal use cases work correctly
- ✅ **Edge case coverage**: Boundary conditions, negative values, zero, large numbers
- ✅ **Error handling**: Invalid inputs, throws, async detection
- ✅ **Integration testing**: End-to-end workflows from parsing to execution
- ✅ **Backward compatibility**: Existing functionality still works alongside new features

## Key Features Tested

### 1. Arithmetic Predicates
```typescript
// All these work and are tested:
x % 2 == 0     // Modulo (even check)
x * 3 > 10     // Multiplication
x + 5 >= 10    // Addition
x - 10 < 50    // Subtraction
x / 2 <= 25    // Division
```

### 2. SafeGraph Serialization
```typescript
const graph = new SafeGraph('test');
// ... build graph ...

// Serialize
const json = graph.toJSON();
const jsonString = JSON.stringify(json);

// Deserialize
const rebuilt = SafeGraph.fromJSON(jsonString);
const program = SafeGraph.fromProgram(json);

// Round-trip works perfectly
```

### 3. Async Detection
```typescript
// All these are correctly rejected:
async () => 42
() => Promise.resolve(42)
() => new Promise(...)
async function* () { yield 1 }

// These work (not actually async):
() => ({ then: 'string' })
() => ({ promise: Promise.resolve(42) })
```

## Integration with Existing Tests

All new tests:
- Follow existing Vitest patterns
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Include descriptive test names
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Don't break existing tests

## Future Test Improvements

Potential areas for additional testing:
1. Performance benchmarks for arithmetic predicates
2. Fuzz testing for parser edge cases
3. Property-based testing for serialization round-trips
4. More complex arithmetic expressions (nested operations)
5. Concurrent execution tests

## Conclusion

This test suite provides **comprehensive coverage** of all new features introduced in the diff:
- Arithmetic predicate support throughout the stack (parser → AST → graph → compiler)
- SafeGraph serialization/deserialization
- Async function detection in budget validation

All tests are **production-ready**, follow **best practices**, and ensure **high code quality** with proper edge case handling and integration testing.
